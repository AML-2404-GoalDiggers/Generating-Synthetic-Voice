# Generating-Synthetic-Voice

Our project describes a neural network-based system for text-to-speech(TTS) synthesis that is able to generate speech audio in the voice of different speakers, including those unseen during training. Dataset will include noisy speech wihtout transcripts from thousands of speakers. Our model will consist of three independent neural networks: a speaker encoder, a synthesizer and a vocoder. The goal of this work is to build aTTS system which can generate natural speech for a variety of different speakers in a data efficient manner.
